# Diaspora Concierge Hub for Eleos Groups

A multilingual web-based platform that helps the Ethiopian diaspora plan and pre-pay for services in Ethiopia, including travel logistics, property management, business setup support, and secure online payments. Built as a Virginia Tech Capstone project in partnership with Eleos Groups.

##  Project Summary

The Diaspora Concierge Hub is a web-based service platform that connects members of the Ethiopian diaspora with trusted travel and property services in Ethiopia. The app allows users to register, submit service requests (e.g., airport pickup, lodging, office rental), plan their trips, AI-powered estimate costs, and complete payments online, through Flutterwave and Paypal â€” all within a multilingual (English/Amharic) interface. An admin dashboard provides backend access to manage requests and service content.
